# 🚀 Express.js Learning Roadmap

This folder contains hands-on code and notes for learning **Express.js**, the most popular Node.js web framework. The goal is to master backend fundamentals while exploring industry-standard patterns, middleware, routing, and architecture.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔧 Core Basics
- Setting up Express server
- Handling routes (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- Using query params and URL parameters
- Serving static files

### 🧱 Middleware
- Custom middleware functions
- `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`
- Logging (e.g., `morgan`)
- Error-handling middleware (centralized error control)

### 🗂️ Routing and Structure
- Route modularization
- API versioning (`/api/v1`)
- Controller-service-repository structure
- Environment configuration using `.env`

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices
- Setting HTTP headers with `helmet`
- CORS management
- Rate limiting & sanitization (`express-rate-limit`, `xss-clean`, `hpp`)
- JWT Authentication & authorization
- Password hashing using `bcrypt`

### 🗃️ Database Integration
- MongoDB with `mongoose`
- CRUD operations via Mongoose Models
- Validation and error handling
- Pagination and filtering

### ⚙️ Performance & Scalability
- Async/await error handling pattern
- Caching strategies with Redis (optional)
- Request throttling
- Load balancing insight

### 📦 Advanced Topics
- File uploads (`multer`)
- Sending emails (`nodemailer`)
- Scheduled jobs (`node-cron`)
- WebSockets with `socket.io`

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use `dotenv` for managing env variables
- Separate logic into **controllers**, **services**, and **routes**
- Never expose sensitive info in logs or responses
- Normalize error responses with a consistent format
- Follow RESTful API design principles
